# Overview

These are my notes on&mdash;and "solutions" to the exercises in&mdash;the book
"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs".

This is only for reference purposes.  If you are working on the book, please
don't peek at these solutions before you work on them yourself: my solutions
might be wrong!  If you do see them, please also think over them and decide for
yourself if they make sense or not.

# Work Environment

I am using an Ubuntu GNU/Linux system to work on the book.  I do have a hard
copy of the book, but I also use the freely available PDF version for
convenience.  The text editor I use is, of course, GNU Emacs, and the Scheme
interpreter I use is GNU Guile.  I use the geiser-guile Emacs mode for Scheme
interaction in Emacs.
